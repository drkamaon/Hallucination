        <h1>Hallucination</h1>
        <p>Currently, a place for <strong>Kamaon</strong> to express himself to the outer world.</p>
        <p>Go <a href="https://github.com/drkamaon" title="This leads to his github profile.">here</a>
            and check him out.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Questionably enough, he translates doujins to Vietnamese.</p>
        <p>There isn't much to say aside from that, so you can click <a href="rdr/hvn.html" title="210vn">here</a>
            to see his work.</p>
